        <h4>Booting and Building</h4>
        <p>It makes sense to begin at the beginning. We'll thoroughly examine how your ember app is built and how it boots up, getting a little hands-on experience with the parts of the framework that glue all of your application code together.</p>

          <h6>Container, Loader and Resolver</h6>
          <p>Like many opinionated web frameworks, most of the code developers write is in hooks: important functions that are called in a predictable way, which may be extended to customize behavior.</p>
          <p>When things appear to go wrong between hooks, being able to peek into a few of the important framework internals can be incredibly valuable. We'll cover three important concepts that will start to give you visibility into what may have previously been a black box.</p>

          <h6>Exercise: Consume ES5 modules in ES6</h6>
          <p>Using our knowledge of the loader, let's put a file in our <code>/vendor</code> folder to make an ES6 module available in our app in totally different namespace.</p>

          <h6>Initializers</h6>
          <p>If you've ever copied and pasted a code from a library's source, in order to customize a little behavior within a complex internal process, you've likely felt the pain of keeping your customized behavior in sync with upstream changes to the library.</p>
          <p>Ember's boot process was built with customization in mind, and provides a mechanism for inserting our own custom code at various places in startup process. These bits of code are called initializers and instance-initializers.</p>
          <p>We'll build on our knowledge of the container, and use the Registration API to prepare it for our app, in some initializers and instance-initializers of our own.</p>

          <h6>Exercise: Container Setup in an Initializer</h6>
          <p>We only want our app to boot up once we have geolocation data. Retrieving this from the browser is an async process, so we'll need to ensure we halt the boot process until it's complete. Once data has been retrieved, put it in the container under the <code>data:location</code> key, in such a way that we only have a single copy of the object used across the whole app.</p>

          <h6>Building with Broccoli</h6>
          <p>Broccoli is the asset pipeline used by ember-cli, and it has one job: transforming and combining files. While the core broccoli library is great, some of the most important build-related stuff happens inside the many broccoli plugins that are used to transpile, minify, uglify and analyze your source code.</p>
          <p>We'll build our own broccoli plugin, explore some debugging techniques and learn some broccoli best practices.</p>

          <p><strong>Note:</strong> you may end up tampering with files after the've already been fingerprinted, so you may need to remove <code>ember-cli-sri</code> from your project.</p>

          <h6>A simple CI/CD Scheme</h6>
          <p>One of the distinct advantages of working with an opinionated framework is that many people are working with the same set of libraries and tools. Continuous integration and continuous deployment typically take a lot of effort to set up, but in the ember world, it's incredibly easy! We'll use Travis-CI and Heroku (coincidentally, two both apps) to automatically test and deploy new code that's pushed to our project's GitHub master branch.</p>

          <p>Set up free continuous integration w/ Travis-CI, create a new app on Heroku using the ember-cli build pack, and have Travis automatically deploy in the event that tests pass.</p>
          <p><strong>BONUS:</strong> setup a heroku pipeline, and enable PR apps, so you can view and play with proposed changes before merging PRs!</p>

          <h6>FastBoot</h6>
          <p>Ember's server side rendering technology is incredibly easy to set up, particularly in comparison to getting something equivalent working in ecosystems that are less opinionated and aligned to a common set of ideas.</p>
          <p>Although both browsers and Node.js both run JavaScript, there are a couple of very important differences that we need to be aware of, as we prepare our app for Fastboot.</p>

          <p>Install <strong>ember-cli-fastboot</strong>, and run <strong>ember fastboot --serve-assets</strong>.

Use our knowledge of Fastboot guards to fix this problem (i.e., skip it if we're running in fastboot land).</p>

          <p>As you start building a sizable app, it's easy to become annoyed at all of the repetitive computed properties that usually come along with conditionals, filtering and transforming data, and mutating values. We'll look at two libraries</p>

            <li>ember-composable-helpers</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Using only a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element, composable helpers, and minimal imperative code in JavaScript files, add a drop down allowing the user to pick between comment types when creating a comment</li>
            <li>Add a filter to the top of the list, allowing us to pick from three modes <em>"fact"</em>, <em>"opinion"</em> or <em>"all"</em></li>

          <p>Authentication is often the first big thing we end up building into a new app, and the approach ember-simple-auth takes has clearly resonated with the Ember community. By building a small set of single-purpose JavaScript modules, and mixing a few things into a few foundational framework objects, we can have authentication working in no time! We'll go a step further and explore the concept of roles, whereby users are granted or denied access to certain routes, based on some data associated with their user object.</p>

        <h4>Modular Architecture</h4>
        <p>One of the unique strengths of the Ember ecosystem is the concept of an Ember Addon.</p>
        <p>The big recent advancement in this area over the past year is the concept of <strong>engines</strong>, a special kind of addon that essentially is an app in and of its self, embedded or mounted in the consuming app.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow's ember apps will take advantage of all of these great capabilities, so we'll thoroughly study the various building blocks, and cover some important and broadly useful scenarios.</p>

          <h6>Addon Basics</h6>
          <p>Ember addons can exist as their own independently-versioned separate projects, or as <strong>in-repo addons</strong> that live within a host app's <code>/lib</code> folder. There are <strong>major</strong> benefits to both of these patterns, so once we cover some common addon basics, we'll outline important differences and practical use cases for each.</p>

          <p>Typically, when working with addons, you have two top-level folders: <code>app</code> and <code>addon</code>, each of which may contain familiar folders like components, routes, etc... . We'll connect back to our newfound knowledge of the container, loader and resolver, to understand important consequences of putting certain types of files in each tree.</p>

          <p>We've already embedded a route-less engine into a view, so let's take things to the next level and mount a routed engine in our router. We'll need to introduce a few new concepts relating to how engines share information with the host app, and pay special attention to the way we create <code>{{link-to}}</code> components that cross the host/engine boundary.</p>

          <p>Beyond encapsulation, one of the biggest benefits that come along with engines is that it frees us from having to pile our entire app into one big set of static assets, to be downloaded as the user first enters. Lazy engines allow chunks of assets to be downloaded on an as-needed basis, as a user crosses an engine boundary.</p>
          <p>Although this adds a little extra complexity to our apps, the performance payoff can be huge, particularly if infrequently-used sections of your app are particularly heavy in terms of dependencies and application code.</p>
