        <h6>Origins, Foundations &amp; Core Principles</h6>
        <p>Elixir is unique, in that it provides us the fantastic ergonomics of a modern programming language, while standing on the solid and battle-tested foundation of the Erlang ecosystem.</p>

        <h6>Interactive Elixir</h6>
        <p>Elixir's interactive shell (IEx) is one of the most powerful tools in your toolbox. We'll outline some of the most useful features for beginners, including</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Running scripts</li>
          <li>Getting metadata about a value</li>

        <h6>IO &amp; Files</h6>
        <p>As with most programming languages, it's useful to know how to interact with files and humans. We'll take care of this early on, and notice a few things that foreshadow some interesting aspects of Elixir's concurrency model.</p>

        <h4>Types, Operators &amp; Control Flow</h4>
        <p>One must crawl before one walks, and it all starts with basic types and procedural logic. Even if you're experienced in a wide range of programming languages, there's going to be a lot of stuff - even at this basic level - that may change the way you look at writing code forever.</p>

        <p>There's no getting away from these kinds of things. Eventually you're going to need to work with numbers and text, so we'll start with a crash course in some core APIs (including a dip in the erlang pool) that will make life easy.</p>
        <p>There's a lot of capability here, but we'll stay close to the commonly-useful and pragmatic path.</p>

        <h6>Tuples and Lists</h6>
        <p>Often times we find ourselves needing to work with several objects in a <em>"collection"</em>, and will need to choose between Elixir's <code>List</code> and <code>Tuple</code> types. We'll compare and contrast tuples and lists, and write a few programs highlighting the benefits of each.</p>

        <p>Assembling a bunch of items in a list is really fast, as long as we do it in a way that doesn't involve moving existing items around in memory. We'll write two programs, one which assembles a bunch of dictionary words into a tuple, and another that uses a list instead.</p>

        <h6>Pattern Matching &amp; Guards</h6>
        <p>This modern language feature allows destructed assignment, and is often used in order to define several variants of a function, each to handle a specific scenario. This application of pattern matching reduces what would otherwise be a lot of internal function complexity by huge amounts.</p>

        <h6>Exercise: Function Refactoring</h6>
        <p>We've got an Elixir module that involves some code that could benefit from some pattern matching magic. Refactor the monolith function so all use of if/else are replaced by creating new functions oriented toward handling that specific pattern of arguments.</p>

        <h6>Conditionals &amp; Guards</h6>
        <p>It's unusual to use if/else in Elixir, because we have some far more powerful approaches to deciding among different branches of code to use. We'll look at the <code>case</code> control flow structure, where pattern matching really starts to shine. We'll also take a look at how <strong>guards</strong> can be added to <code>case</code> clauses (and other control flow structures) to form even more specific and targeted patterns.</p>

        <h4>Writing modular Programs</h4>
        <p>Elixirs module system allows us to define layers of related functions. In this part of the course, we'll explore the concepts of modules, and the ability to reference code in one module from another.</p>

        <h6>Modules &amp; three important Directives</h6>
        <p>Modules are just a group of several functions, some of which may be private and some of which may be public. Modules give us the ability to define named functions using the <code>def</code> macro, which offer a few other features that were unavailable in the world of anonymous functions.</p>

        <h4>Request, Response</h4>
        <p>A Phoenix app can basically be boiled down to a function that receives a HTTP request, and returns a response. We'll begin with this premise, and start to understand the important parts involved in this process.</p>

        <h4>Managing Data</h4>
        <p>Data is an integral part of virtually any web application, and a great persistence library make a huge difference in performance and maintainability.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, the Elixir ecosystem has us covered in spades. Ecto is a thin layer of functions that allow us to build composable queries, validate fields, and seamlessly transform records between our DB and application representations.</p>

      <div class="col-xs-9 col-sm-10">
        <h6>Intro to Ecto</h6>
        <p>Heavy persistence libraries like ActiveRecord offer convenience, but often become performance bottlenecks. We could make every DB query explicitly, but then we're trading in all of our ergonomics for performance.</p>
        <p>Ecto manages to strike an enjoyable balance, where we are asked to be deliberate about the records we fetch from a database but (most of the time) aren't dragged into the world of writing SQL queries explicitly.</p>
        <p>You'll be amazed at how much we can do with just simple functions, and will never look at other persistence frameworks quite the same way again.</p>

        <h6>Managing Migrations</h6>
        <p>If you've never used code to manage changes to your database schema, you're missing out. Migrations allow us to change our schema in (ideally) reversible steps, so we can apply and un-apply a set of changes while building features. Even if you've seen migrations before, there are some useful things to know about how they work with Ecto, and in particular, Postgres. We'll look, specifically at:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Postgres array and jsonb column types</li>
          <li>Changing column types, while remaining backwards compatible</li>

        <h6>Cracking Changesets</h6>
        <p>This is one of my favorite parts about Ecto, and one of the parts you'll be most often working with. In contrast to other persistence libraries, <strong>the concept of the shape of a record (schema) and the logic for checking the validity of values (validations) are decoupled</strong>. There are some incredibly exciting consequences of this design decision.</p>
        <p>Ecto ships with a bunch of validations, and because it's so quick and easy, we'll write a few of our own.</p>

        <h6>Quick Queries</h6>
        <p>While we could use SQL syntax to retrieve records from our database, doing so would open us up to a world of pain. Ecto provides an approachable and composable way of building queries, while stopping short of doing us any <em>"automatic favors"</em> (i.e., N+1 queries) that so often degrade performance.</p>

        <h4>Real Time</h4>
        <p>One of the places where Elixir and Phoenix leave the competition in the dust is support for soft real time programming. The ability to keep a lightweight Elixir process running for the duration of a user's time in our app, and holding some small amount of state, makes things far simpler for certain things than it otherwise would be.</p>

        <h6>Channel Basics</h6>
        <p>Phoenix Channels are a first class citizen in the framework, on equal footing with Controllers. It shows! You'll be amazed at how easy it is to start adding real-time features to your apps, where we push data from server to client.</p>
        <p>Development best practices are increasingly moving in a functional and <em>"stateless"</em> direction, but Elixir Processes are a place where small pieces of state can be safely held and used. We'll explore how powerful this idea is, in the context of Phoenix channels.</p>

        <h6>Managing Channel Complexity</h6>
        <p>While you may have contributed to a REST API project that had 10 endpoints (each handling 1-4 HTTP verbs), it's less likely that you have experience working with a long-lived web socket connection operating on the same scale of complexity. It's important to remember that this is API surface, and <strong>because it's often stateful instead of stateless, keeping organized is even more important</strong>.</p>

        <h4>Users &amp; Authentication</h4>
        <p>Nearly every app we build these days requires some sort of authentication, and probably a user account to go along with it. Even if your app is an oddball and doesn't need this, user accounts provide us with a well-understood set of use cases that will serve as an excellent case study.</p>
        <p>Let's put some of our newfound Phoenix knowledge into practice as we implement a secure user account feature set. The goal will be to reduce explicit management of authorization &amp; authentication on a per-resource basis as much as possible.</p>

        <p>We'll validate a user's credentials in a way that's not incredibly sensitive to timing or brute force attacks, and then assemble our little piece of session state (the JWT) before encrypting it and handing it back to the client.</p>
